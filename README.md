# 💫 About Me:
👋🏽 Hi! I'm Emma ☺️ — a passionate learner, creative thinker, and someone who believes that technology can make life more meaningful. My background combines digital data analysis and front-end development, but what truly drives me is the joy of solving problems, connecting ideas, and creating experiences that matter.

> [!NOTE]
> Outside of work, you'll usually find me with a good ☕ cup of coffee in hand, lost in a detective series (I love a good mystery 🔍!).
> I believe in growth, kindness, and the magic of small details — whether in data, design, or daily life.
