# 💫 About Me:
👋🏽 Hi! I'm Emma ☺️ — Hey, I’m Emma​, a forever curious mind, web & digital creative with a big love for all things that make us feel and think deeper. I’m into mindful design, astrology, mental health, and building digital spaces that truly support people (especially mamas 💜).

> [!NOTE]
> Outside of work, you'll usually find me with a good ☕ cup of coffee in hand, lost in a detective series (I love a good mystery 🔍!).
> I believe in growth, kindness, and the magic of small details — whether in data, design, or daily life.
