👋🏽 Hi, I’m **Emma** — a junior **AI Engineer / Frontend Developer** focused on building **AI-powered web applications** with scalable, backend-driven architectures.

My work centers on integrating **LLM-based systems**, **RAG pipelines**, and API-driven services into modern web applications. I enjoy designing clear, performant interfaces while supporting them with **Node.js backends**, structured data flows, and retrieval-focused systems that make AI outputs reliable and useful.

I’m especially interested in building **responsible, human-centered AI systems**, with a strong focus on clarity, accessibility, and real-world usability.

> [!NOTE]  
> Outside of coding, you’ll usually find me with a cup of coffee ☕, exploring a good mystery series, or learning new AI concepts.  
> I value clean architectures, thoughtful data flows, and continuous learning.
